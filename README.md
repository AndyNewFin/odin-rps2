# odin-rps2 4/9/2022
File backup created to make sure original files are safe before editing/branch

I am starting the Revisiting Rock-Paper-Scissor project where I need to initially create a branch on github

I decided to create a new repo: odin-rps2, copy files over, then create a new branch to the new repo

Note: The script.js file does NOT work - I tried to
     1) Code on my own with help from TOP instructions; Google; TOP Discord; Stack Overflow, but could not get anything to work with my current code
     2) Reviewed some TOP solutions and get some inspiration, but again, could not get anything to work with my current code
     3) After nearly a week, I decided it was best to start this project from using with help from YouTube's "Jaybees Tech Talk"
	3a) File script2.js is basically a me watching Jaybees Tech Talk video "The Odin Project VLOG | Day 51 CODING For BEGINNERS | JavaScript Project Rock Paper Scissors REVISED" and coding along with him

I am hoping I do have to do this too much in future projects since I believe it is best to learn via my own code and solutions.

Positive note: I am happy that I understood and familiar with most of what Jaybees Tech Talk had to teach! I reviewed each line of code to understand what each line did; how each line connects; and how all the lines come together to solve this project


Need to work on:
1) Slowing down to carefully make sure no typos/mispelling and that punctuation marks are correct
2) Understating that some keywords are CASE-sensitive: in the button.addEventListener, I had "Click" instead of "click" which caused it not to work
3) Dom methods: This project heavily emphasized DOM methods to add/update the html... I originally had a style.css file
